## Prerequisite

- Create the walls base as well as the Ball object.
- Instead of creating 3d holes, I have used 2d png image of Death hole which will be used to eliminate the ball as soon as the collision occurs.

Use an accelerometer as a game controller to control the ball object in Unity.

1) Download the scripts

2) Add Ball and Player Controller script to the Ball object as shown.
